 # Hats of Two Colors:
 There are 12 very smart prisoners in a jail. To get rid of them, the warden
 comes up with the following test. He will put a hat, either black or white,
 ontheheadofeachoftheseprisoners.Therewillbeatleastonehatofeach
 color, and the prisoners will be informed about this fact. They will be able
 to see everyone elseâ€™s hat but their own; there will be no communications
 of any kind among the prisoners. The warden will line up the prisoners
 every 5 minutes starting at 12:05pm and ending at 12:55pm. To pass the
 test, all the prisoners with a black hat and only those prisoners will have to
 step forward during the same line up. If they do, all the prisoners will be
 freed, otherwise they will beexecuted.Howcantheprisonerspassthetest?
